Code to verify if a collection of stars found in the Gaia database is an open cluster.

# Open clusters:
group of stars (up to several thousand) formed from a single molecular cloud and having approximately the same age.

You may have seen such open clusters in the sky in the constellation Taurus... It's M45 or the Pleiades!

## Typical features of open clusters:

### 1) Similar chemical composition 

In articles on astronomy, you can see the terms "abundance" and "metallicity". The first term is usually used to define the amount of a chemical element in relation to the amount of such an element in the Sun, but can be defined differently. The second term usually refers to the ratio of the abundance of Fe in a star (object) to the abundance of Fe in the Sun, but can be defined differently.

### 2) Located either in the galactic disk or near it:

The younger the open cluster the further away from the galactic center and the older ones go beyond the disk. (in spiral galaxies). 

### 3) Star formation:

After the collapse and fragmentation of a giant molecular cloud, young stars appear. The hottest stars of the spectral class O-B form H II regions around them, where new stars are formed.

### 4) Gravitationally bound group of stars:

The stars in open clusters are connected by gravity and move together in space, located about the same distance from the observer. (This means that the parallax <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\pi" title="\pi" /> and proper motion <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\mu" title="\mu" /> of stars within open clusters must be similar.)

If the gravitational connection is lost, but the stars still move in the same direction at similar speeds, then this group of stars is called the stellar association.

### Hertzsprungâ€“Russell diagram

shows us the age of the cluster (which also indicates the type of cluster: open, globular, etc.) using the characteristic deviation from the main sequence (MS) and the initial main sequence.
